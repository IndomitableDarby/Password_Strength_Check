# Password Strength Checker

This is a simple GUI application built using Python's tkinter library that allows users to evaluate and generate passwords based on certain criteria. The application provides visual feedback on the strength of passwords entered by the user and offers the ability to generate secure passwords with customizable options.

## Features

- Password Evaluation:
  - Checks password strength based on length, character set, and common password checks.
  - Provides visual indication of password strength (Weak, Medium, Strong) and estimated vulnerability to hacking.

- Password Generation:
  - Generates random passwords based on specified length and character set preferences (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters).

- Dynamic User Interface:
  - Toggles password visibility for user convenience.
  - Updates background color and progress bar dynamically based on password strength.

## Usage

1. Evaluation:
   - Enter a password in the "Enter Password" field and click "Evaluate" to check its strength.
   - The application will display the strength level (Weak, Medium, Strong) and estimated vulnerability.

2. Generation:
   - Specify the desired password length and character set preferences.
   - Click "Generate Password" to generate a random password based on the selected criteria.

3. Password Visibility:
   - Click the "Show/Hide" button next to the password field to toggle password visibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter (standard library)
